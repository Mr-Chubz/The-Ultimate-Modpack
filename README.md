# The-Ultimate-Modpack
Many mods are conjoined into one to make the ultimate mod pack! --Greater unit and building variety, more useful resourdes, and more technologies and policies!-- (Most content in this mod is not content of my own)

Credit goes to Sullien - (Future Expansion), General Wadaling - (Warfare Expanded), Huymnsel - (Ariel Expanded), Cavenir - (Extra Resources), and Angelonious - (Project Rikugun + Project Kaigun).

This is a compilation of mods that I thought would compliment one another with an emphasis on developing assymetry at each tech level. This most likely appeals to the player that takes the game at a slow pace.

If you find any issues feel free to let me know! This is still in its early stages and I already know of some things that need tweaking. I plan on eventually further expanding the future eras.
